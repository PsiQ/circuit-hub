# Circuit Hub

**Circuit Hub** is a centralized repository for storing and sharing `.circuit` files used by **Circuit Designer**. It serves as a growing library of example, research, and community-contributed quantum circuits.


## What is Circuit Designer?

[Circuit Designer](https://circuits.psiquantum.com/cdx/) is an intuitive tool that enables you easily explore quantum algorithm ideas and create publication-quality quantum computing circuit diagrams. Circuit Designer allows you to effortlessly drag, drop, group, and arrange quantum circuit elements on an infinitely expandable canvas.


## What is a `.circuit` file?

`.circuit` is the native file format used by Circuit Designer. These files describe quantum circuit diagrams created in Circuit Designer and can be viewed and edited in the tool.

## Circuit Hub Contents

- **Community Circuits:** Contributions from the broader community, shared for learning, reuse, and collaboration.
  
- **Demo Circuits:** Example circuits showcasing Circuit Designer features and common quantum patterns.

- **PsiQuantum Research Circuits:** Curated circuits developed and used by PsiQuantum researchers.
